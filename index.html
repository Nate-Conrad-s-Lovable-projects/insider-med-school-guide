              After a lot of hard work and some luck, I was able to get into UCLA, one of the top schools in the country. 
              I was jumping off the walls when I got that letter!

                First, I successfully got into 3 medical schools myself. While I learned a lot from this process, 
                I still wasn't totally sure why I got in.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, I spent time on the UCLA medical school admissions committee.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here I interviewed applicants, reviewed applications, and ranked applicants along 
                with other members of the committee.
              </p>
              <p>
                From this experience, I can say that I learned exactly what it takes to get into a top school.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past several years, I have been using that knowledge to help many people get into medical school.

                As someone who had no clue how the medical school admissions process even worked, I was pretty nervous to apply. I knew the basics such as the progression from primary to secondary application. But, when it came to starting my personal statement and navigating which schools to apply to, I was lost. I then came across Mike's services.
              </p>
              <p>
                When my medical school interview days arrived, I am proud to say that I wasn't nervous at all! Thanks to Dr. Frazier's interview preparation, I was fully prepared for all the questions thrown my way. In fact, I received my first acceptance from UC Davis (one of my dream schools!) as early as October, and Dr. Frazier's help was definitely pivotal in helping me get there.
