              <p>Dear Premed Student,</p>
              <p>
                My name is Mike Frazier and I'm a former UCLA medical school admissions committee member and 
                graduate of UCLA medical school. I remember well the days when I was a premed student. 
                It seemed like everything I was doing was geared towards one goal: getting into medical school. 
                I was studying like crazy, volunteering all over the place, and working part time, 
                all the while wondering if what I was doing was enough to get accepted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe you can relate. Before I spent time on the UCLA admissions committee, I had a pretty good 
                idea of what it took to get into medical school. After my time on the admissions committee, 
                I can tell you that I now understand exactly what it takes to get accepted to a top medical school like UCLA.
              </p>

                    This book is a great and easy-to-read guide to prepare someone to get into medical school. Mike's advice on my personal statement and activities helped me to develop an application that more fully represented me as a person. I most appreciated his guidance on how to make my personal statement and AMCAS application more personable. I was proud of my final application, and I was ultimately accepted to Harvard, Brown, UCSF and the University of Colorado. It was great to have Mike's objective input and I would definitely recommend his help to other pre-med students!

                    This book is the sole thing that kept my head on straight while I was trying to get into medical school. So many times I was not sure where to start or what the next step was. This book clearly lays out things that you must do to make yourself a stronger applicant. I was amazed at how detailed it was with each aspect of the application/interview/acceptance process. My very favorite part was its discussion about the interview. This saved my neck during my interviews!

                    As someone who had no clue how the medical school admissions process even worked, I was pretty nervous to apply. I knew the basics such as the progression from primary to secondary application. But, when it came to starting my personal statement and navigating which schools to apply to, I was lost. I then came across Mike's services.

                  <p>
                    Getting the perspective from someone who has seen the inner workings of the admissions committee was invaluable during the stressful application process. To sum it up, Dr. Frazier was awesome! And I would definitely recommend his products and services to anyone hoping to get accepted.
