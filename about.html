            <p>My name is Mike Frazier, MD. I'm a graduate of UCLA medical school and former UCLA medical school admissions committee member.</p>
            
            <h3 class="mt-4">Why I Built this Site</h3>
            <p>I remember what it was like to be a premed student. All you think about is how to get into medical school! That 92 on the test that gets you the A- instead of the A drives you crazy, thinking that it might make the difference in getting admitted or not. You are super busy with activities, community service, shadowing, etc.</p>
            <p>I was always looking for advice during this time and welcomed any that I could get. I built this site to try to answer the questions that I had when I was applying to medical school. I want you to learn from my experiences and get accepted, just like I did. Or do it even better!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="mt-4">
          <p>Aside from being a premed and medical student myself, the most important experience I had to help you get into medical school is my time on the UCLA admissions committee.</p>
          <p>Here I saw first hand exactly what it takes to get into medical school. I've turned what I learned from these experiences into my eBook <a href="10-steps-to-accepted.html">10 Steps to Accepted</a>. I've priced it at $20 to make it affordable on any budget.</p>
          <p>Now that I'm through medical school (and managed to land my top choice residency!), the site is also built to help medical students succeed in medical school, and I've put an ebook together about that called <strong>Succeeding in Medical School- How to Land Your Top Choice Residency</strong> which you'll get free if you purchase 10 Steps or you can purchase it here.</p>

              <p>Hopefully you find the information that you are looking for on this site. There are other sites with good information as well, but be careful who you listen to when it comes to advice on medical school admissions. The only people who really know what it takes are people who have been on an admissions committee.</p>
              <p>If you find others with that experience as well, you can trust that they know what they're talking about. If they haven't had that experience, they're really just guessing.</p>

          <p>I've now moved on to helping men with their marriage at Strong Men Strong Marriages, but refer my pre-med friends to the company I used to work for, MedSchoolCoach team to help provide you with top-of-the-line admissions consulting. Everyone on the team has experience on admissions committees, which is what you need so you get the best advice possible.</p>
          <p>They work with personal statements, AMCAS applications, interviews and general advising. Their packages are comprehensive and outstanding and the Gold package even offers GUARANTEED acceptance. You can check out <a href="http://www.medschoolcoach.com/ref/4/">MedSchoolCoach here</a>. They would love to work with you to help you get into your top choice medical school!</p>
          <p>Remember, 60% of applicants do not get accepted to any medical school! Money spent on advising is money well spent. Just reapplying will probably cost you more than paying for advising to do it right the first time! Let them help you at MedSchoolCoach.</p>

            <h3 class="text-primary">Psychiatrist</h3>
            <p>After changing my mind throughout medical school, I finally decided on psychiatry. I came in thinking I'd go into psychiatry and eventually came back to it after my rotation at UCLA. I love the field and am excited to practice in it!</p>
            <p>I feel like in this field you really get to treat the whole person. You take into account their social issues, financial issues, health issues, everything. And if you can help people overcome mental illness, you have given them their life back. They can accomplish goals that they could not have accomplished otherwise.</p>
            <p>I've now focused those skills into helping men save their marriages through Marriage Coaching at Strong Men Strong Marriages (also a podcast).</p>

            <h3 class="text-primary">Business Man</h3>
            <p>I graduated from Brigham Young University with a Neuroscience major and a Business minor. A business minor is something I suggest for all premed students, by the way!</p>
            <p>Whether you are interested in running your own practice or if you just want to know how to invest your money wisely (once you get a salary!), business education will be useful to you for the rest of your life.</p>
            <p>One big thing you learn from business is the importance of passive income. Passive income is money that comes in without you having to trade time for it. Being a doctor is not passive income. You trade your time for money. You get paid well for your time, but if you stop working your money stops coming in.</p>
            <p>The more income streams you have, the better.</p>
