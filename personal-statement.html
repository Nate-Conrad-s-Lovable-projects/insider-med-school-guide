        <p>The medical school personal statement can strike fear into the heart of the medical school applicant.</p>
        <p>However, it does not have to be that way! Think of this as your chance to set yourself apart from other medical students. With at little bit of work, your personal statement for medical school can tell the medical school admissions committee who you are and why they should want you.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
          <p>Remember that there are many factors that medical schools are looking for in choosing an applicant. You need to understand all the things that schools are looking for to make your dream of becoming a doctor a reality.</p>

        <p>If after going through these rules you find that you would like some more medical school essay help, editing of your statement is also available by MedSchoolCoach <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
        <p>MedSchoolCoach is the company I recommend for medical school personal statement help as well as admissions advising. They are all former admissions committee members, which means they know exactly what schools are looking for and what it takes to be accepted. Their rates are also very reasonable compared to other companies. Consulting can cost some money, but think of it as an investment. Whatever you spend now will get you $150,000 to $500,000 for 30+ years, doing something you love. Not a bad return on investment!</p>

        <h2>5 Key Rules for a Standout Personal Statement</h2>
        
        <div class="rule-box">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col col-12 col-md-8">
              <h3 class="text-primary">Rule #1: Show, Don't Tell</h3>
              <p>A common theme in the medical school personal statement is "I want to be a doctor because I want to help people." This is probably true, but the problem is this: anyone can say that, and most applicants do say that. You need to show me why that's true. What experience did you have that made you want to help people?</p>
              <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Sample Personal Statement Excerpt:</h4>
                <p class="font-italic">"I could smell the rotting garbage in the streets. I was far from home in my third week in Guatemala as part of a medical mission. The people were so poor, but so grateful. I was working with Pedro, bandaging a cut on his hand after an accident sharpening his machete. He looked up at me and said "Gracias, amigo." Those simple words lifted my spirits. My work here was making a difference, small as it might be. I want to continue to make that difference and feel the joy of helping others through a career in medicine."</p>
                <p><strong>What's good about this:</strong> It shows that you want to help people by your experience and it's an experience that only you had. Individuality is the key to the medical school personal statement.</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Rule #2: It's Story Time</h3>
              <p>Your medical school personal statement should be a collection of your experiences and what they taught you. Those experiences should have taught you things that will make you a good doctor. Remember to think from the perspective of the reader.</p>
              <p>The reader wants to know who you are and that you have developed certain character traits through your experiences. These should include things like service, compassion, integrity, dedication, diligence, tenacity, leadership, etc.</p>
              <p>Tell a story, then tell what it taught you. How will that lesson make you a good doctor? This is what will make your personal statement for medical school stand out.</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Rule #3: Make It Entertaining</h3>
              <p>If you're not having fun writing it, they're not having fun reading it!</p>
              <p>Remember that the people reading these have read many, many medical school personal statements. If you are telling stories that are meaningful to you, that will come across and make it an entertaining read for the person reviewing your application.</p>
              <p>Use humor if that is one of your talents. If someone laughs while reading your essay, that's a good thing. It may be the first laugh the person reading all these medical school essays has had in a while.</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Rule #4: Don't Make It Too Personal</h3>
              <p>While you want to show who you are in your medical school personal statement, you don't want to give up too much. This can be a fine line, but just keep this principle in mind: Don't write anything that you don't want the interviewer to ask you about. Do that and you'll be fine.</p>
              <p>For example, your medical school admission essay is not the time to bring up your past as a juvenile delinquent. If you do this, you need some medical school essay help!</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Rule #5: Have Others Read Your Statement</h3>
              <p>At the end of the day, writing is about how other people respond to what you have written. Have someone look through your medical school essay.</p>
              <p>The ideal person to review your medical school essay will be someone who is a good writer and who will give you honest feedback. Don't just choose people who will say your essay is great even if it's not. Your mom probably falls under this category. Your boyfriend or girlfriend probably does too.</p>
              <p>You probably don't need professional editing unless:</p>
              <ul class="styled-list">
                <li>You can't find someone who is a good writer to review your essay</li>
                <li>You're explaining hardships</li>
                <li>English is not your first language</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If one of these or other reasons is the case, a good editor really comes in handy. The company I recommend for this is MedSchoolCoach.</p>

              <ul class="styled-list">
                <li><strong>Hook:</strong> Something that immediately grabs the reader's attention. From the sample medical school essay above, the first sentence was "I could smell the rotting garbage in the streets." That's something interesting that makes the reader want to keep reading.</li>
                <li><strong>Story time:</strong> Tell your first story.</li>
                <li><strong>What it taught you:</strong> What character trait/quality does this experience demonstrate? What did the experience teach you?</li>

              <p>Same structure as introduction - story, followed by reflection and insight.</p>
              <p>You only want the medical school personal statement to be about one page. AMCAS limits your medical school personal statement to 5300 characters (about one page). Don't get carried away.</p>
              
              <div class="example-box">
                <h4>Sample Body Paragraph:</h4>
                <p class="font-italic">"Not only have I had the chance to be a mentor, I have had the chance to be mentored by inspiring physicians. I sat in the small whitewashed room with Dr. Petrie at the red cross building in El Fuerte, Mexico, waiting for our next patient. Dr. Petrie had flown us from Fullterton, CA to Mexico at his own expense in his 4-seater yellow Bonanza aircraft. A man in cowboy boots and hat came into the small whitewashed room with his family, rolled up his plaid sleeve and showed us a large growth on his right bicep. Dr. Petrie asked a few questions about it and whether he wanted it removed. When the man said yes, Dr. Petrie replied with a smile, "So you don't want to look like a strong man anymore?" There was a sense of relief in the laughter of the man and his family. They knew that the person who would perform the surgery cared not just about the growth but about the man."</p>

                <li><strong>Summary:</strong> Summarize your qualities learned/demonstrated by your experiences.</li>

                <p class="font-italic">"...They knew that the person who would perform the surgery cared not just about the growth but about the man. I want to be that kind of doctor. The kind who shows he cares with a smile. The kind that takes the time not only to prescribe, but to educate. The kind dedicated to healing and helping. That's who I want to be."</p>

              <li><strong>Don't be afraid to make it short.</strong> The medical school essay should only be about one page long.</li>
              <li><strong>Block left.</strong> Do not indent your paragraphs. It's easier for the eye to read this way and it looks better.</li>
