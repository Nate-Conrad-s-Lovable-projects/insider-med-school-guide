                    <p className="mb-4">
                      A common theme in the medical school personal statement is "I want to be a doctor because I want to help people." 
                      This is probably true, but the problem is this: anyone can say that, and most applicants do say that. You need 
                      to show me why that's true. What experience did you have that made you want to help people? Likewise, don't 
                      just say that you've done research or community service. Tell a story only you can tell about it and what it 
                      taught you that will make you a good doctor.

                      <p className="font-bold mb-2">Here's part of a sample medical school essay that shows that you want to help people:</p>
                      <p className="italic">
                        I could smell the rotting garbage in the streets. I was far from home in my third week in Guatemala as part 
                        of a medical mission. The people were so poor, but so grateful. I was working with Pedro, bandaging a cut on 
                        his hand after an accident sharpening his machete. He looked up at me and said "Gracias, amigo." Those simple 
                        words lifted my spirits. My work here was making a difference, small as it might be. I want to continue to make 
                        that difference and feel the joy of helping others through a career in medicine.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      What's good about this: It shows that you want to help people by your experience and it's an experience that 
                      only you had. Individuality is the key to the medical school personal statement.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                      This goes along with show don't tell, but your medical school personal statement should be a collection of your 
                      experiences and what they taught you. Those experiences should have taught you things that will make you a good doctor. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Remember to think from the perspective of the reader. The reader wants to know who you are and that you have developed 
                      certain character traits through your experiences. These should include things like service, compassion, integrity, 
                      dedication, diligence, tenacity, leadership, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Everyone will be trying to show that they have those qualities, but you will have the advantage because you will
                      show the reader by your experiences that you have those qualities.

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-primary mb-3">Rule #3: Make it entertaining. If you're not having fun writing it, they're not having fun reading it!</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Remember that the people reading these have read many, many medical school personal statements. If you are telling stories 
                    that are meaningful to you, that will come across and make it an entertaining read for the person reviewing your application.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    If you're not having fun writing it, they're not having fun reading it. I'm repeating this because it's so important.
                    Remember this as your write all of your essays, including the medical school personal statement, your descriptions 
                    of activities, and your secondary application essays.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Use humor if that is one of your talents. If someone laughs while reading your essay, that's a good thing. It may be the 
                    first laugh the person reading all these medical school essays has had in a while.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    While you want to show who you are in your medical school personal statement, you don't want to give up too much. 
                    This can be a fine line, but just keep this principle in mind: Don't write anything that you don't want the interviewer 
                    to ask you about. Do that and you'll be fine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For example, your medical school admission essay is not the time to bring up your past as a juvenile delinquent. If you do
                    this, you need some medical school essay help!

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    At the end of the day, writing is about how other people respond to what you have written. Have someone look through 
                    your medical school essay.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    The ideal person to review your medical school essay will be someone who is a good writer and who will give you 
                    honest feedback about your personal statement for medical school. Don't just choose people who will say your essay 
                    is great even if it's not. Your mom probably falls under this category. Your boyfriend or girlfriend probably does too.

                      medical school essay above, the first sentence was "I could smell the rotting garbage in the streets." That's something 
                      interesting that makes the reader want to keep reading.

                  <p className="italic">
                    Not only have I had the chance to be a mentor, I have had the chance to be mentored by inspiring physicians. 
                    I sat in the small whitewashed room with Dr. Petrie at the red cross building in El Fuerte, Mexico, waiting for 
                    our next patient. Dr. Petrie had flown us from Fullterton, CA to Mexico at his own expense in his 4-seater yellow 
                    Bonanza aircraft. A man in cowboy boots and hat came into the small whitewashed room with his family, rolled up his plaid
                    sleeve and showed us a large growth on his right bicep. Dr. Petrie asked a few questions about it and whether he wanted 
                    it removed. When the man said yes, Dr. Petrie replied with a smile, "So you don't want to look like a strong man anymore?" 
                    There was a sense of relief in the laughter of the man and his family. They knew that the person who would perform the 
                    surgery cared not just about the growth but about the man.
                  </p>

                  <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>
                      <span className="font-medium">Summary of your qualities learned/demonstrated by your experiences:</span> You want

            {/* Outlining Tips */}
            <div className="mb-12">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Outlining your essay</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As I've been editing medical school personal statements, I've been giving some advice that I think would be useful. 
                When you write your personal statement for medical school, start by outlining it in the following way:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li>Start with your initial interest in medicine</li>
                <li>Then track your progress through your most meaningful experiences</li>
                <li>By the end, we should see how your interest in medicine turned into a passion for medicine</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                It can also be useful to have an "MO" as you write. The committee should have a good idea of what your main interest 
                in medicine is. It might be service, research, an interest in the human body, or something else. Whatever it is, it 
                should be clear by the end of your essay.
              </p>
            </div>

            {/* Key Points */}
            <div className="mb-12">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">A Few Other Key Points</h2>
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-4">
                <li>
                  <span className="font-medium">Use names.</span> Using names makes the personal statement for medical school more, well, personal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span className="font-medium">Be active and specific in your language.</span> When you do your description of activities in AMCAS, 
                  use active language. For example, instead of writing "Mentor" in your heading, write "Mentor to Sam, 10 year old with cerebral palsy." 
                  This is more personal and more descriptive. Instead of "worked at Albertson's" write "Courtesy Clerk at Albertson's." Then tell 
                  your story and what it taught you in your description, always remembering that the reader is looking for things that will make 
                  you a good doctor. This is the key of great medical school essays.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span className="font-medium">Don't be afraid to make it short.</span> The medical school essay should only be about one page long. 
                  In fact, AMCAS limits your medical school personal statement to 5300 characters (about one page). Likewise, the descriptions of 
                  activities should not be too long. One of my best activities was "Husband and Father" and the description was "the best, hardest, 
                  most rewarding thing I do." Memorable and unique. That's what you're going for in the medical school personal statement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span className="font-medium">Block left.</span> This means do not indent your paragraphs. It's easier for the eye to read this 
                  way and it looks better. Remember that the reader is reading many medical school personal statements and this will give him or 
                  her a break for the eyes.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Using professional editing services</h2>

                <div className="md:flex-1">
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    As I said above, there are many medical school personal statement editing services available online and even through 
                    your college. You can use your premed office or many schools have a writing center where people who are good writers 
                    can review your statement.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-6">
                    However, your personal statement for medical school should not be something you leave to
                    chance. Your best bet is to work with someone who has experience with the medical school personal statement from the 
                    other side of the admissions table. As I said above, the company I recommend for medical school essay help is MedSchoolCoach.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  The reason I like this company is because they are all doctors who have had experience on a medical school admissions committee. 
                  That means they know exactly what it is that schools are looking for. They also have an excellent success rate and have 
                  helped students get into top tier schools like Harvard medical school.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also like them because their prices are very reasonable, even compared to other companies with less specialized experience. 
                  They offer personal statement editing along with many other options to help you achieve your goal of becoming a doctor. 
                  Remember, the personal statement for medical school is only part of the equation. MedSchoolCoach offers complete packages 
                  (which include medical school essay help) for a great price.
