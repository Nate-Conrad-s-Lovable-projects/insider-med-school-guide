                  I'm Dr. Mike Frazier, a physician and former member of the UCLA Medical School Admissions Committee.
                  My journey in medicine has provided me with unique insights into what it takes to succeed in this
                  challenging and rewarding field.

                <p>
                  After successfully navigating the medical school application process myself and gaining acceptance to
                  multiple top schools, I served on the UCLA admissions committee where I interviewed candidates,
                  reviewed applications, and participated in selection decisions that determined who would become
                  the next generation of physicians.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">My Background</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                I graduated from UCLA School of Medicine, where I excelled academically and was actively 
                involved in student leadership, research, and community service. During my time there, 
                I developed a passion for helping others achieve their dream of becoming physicians.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                After completing my medical training, I was invited to serve on the UCLA Medical School 
                Admissions Committee, where I gained invaluable insight into the selection process. 
                This experience allowed me to see firsthand what distinguishes successful applicants 
                from those who are rejected.
              </p>
              <p>
                For several years now, I've been using this knowledge to help pre-med students craft 
                winning applications, prepare for interviews, and ultimately gain acceptance to medical school.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">My Approach</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                I believe that every aspiring physician has unique strengths and a personal story that can make 
                them stand out in the competitive medical school application process. My approach is to help 
                students identify and showcase these strengths while addressing any weaknesses in their application.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Unlike some admissions consultants who provide generic advice, I offer insights based on actual 
                experience evaluating applications. I know what admissions committees are truly looking for because 
                I've been on that side of the table.
              </p>
              <p>
                My goal is not just to help you get into medical school, but to help you get into the right 
                medical school for youâ€”one where you'll thrive and develop into the physician you aspire to be.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Success Stories</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Over the years, I've helped hundreds of pre-med students achieve their dreams of becoming doctors. 
                My clients have been accepted to top medical schools across the country, including Harvard, Johns Hopkins, 
                UCSF, NYU, Vanderbilt, and many others.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm particularly proud of my work with non-traditional applicants, re-applicants, and those with 
                academic challenges who had been told their dreams of becoming physicians were unrealistic. 
                Many of these students are now successful doctors, proving that with the right guidance and 
                preparation, seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome.
