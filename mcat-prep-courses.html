                    Probably the most well known MCAT prep course. Kaplan has a
                    long history of MCAT test prep, and a long history of
                    getting solid results. You'll get a brief overview here. For
                    a more comprehensive review, click here.

                  <h3>Teachers</h3>
                  <p>
                    Kaplan MCAT prep course teachers (the on-site teachers) are
                    generally students who have done well on certain sections of
                    the MCAT. For example, a student who scored a 13 or higher
                    on MCAT physics could be your MCAT tutor for physics. Some
                    of my classmates at UCLA medical school were teachers for
                    the Kaplan MCAT prep courses.

                  <h3>The Process</h3>
                  <p>
                    For any of the Kaplan MCAT courses, you'll start with an
                    initial test to establish your baseline. This is important
                    for their "higher score guarantee," which we'll cover later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's also just a good idea to begin with a practice test
                    whether you choose Kaplan or not so that you can recognize
                    where you're starting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You'll then go to about 24 classes over around a semester
                    and take 5 practice exams through your course.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kaplan MCAT prep also has the advantage of their Smart
                    Reports, which we'll also cover later, but basically you'll
                    get a personalized map of where you are strong and where you
                    are weak so you can tailor your studying. Definitely a
                    bonus!

                  <h3>Kaplan MCAT Options/Packages and Prices</h3>
                  <p>
                    Kaplan MCAT prep course offers a wide variety of options in
                    their MCAT prep course. They were the first to do many of
                    these, which have now also been implemented by other
                    companies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You should also be aware that Kaplan MCAT has promotions
                    almost every month, so be on the lookout to save money
                    compared to their normal prices.

              <h4>In-Person Options</h4>
              <p>
                These Kaplan MCAT prep course options are good choices if you
                learn better in a traditional classroom setting where you are
                physically with other students and your teacher.
              </p>
              <p>
                Included in your resources for any of these courses are all 8
                AAMC practice tests and 11 Kaplan practice tests, as well as
                11,000 practice questions with explanations.
              </p>
              <p>
                You'll also get online access to 130 hours of recorded lectures
                by great teachers, so you'll be able to review material whenever
                you choose. They range in price between $2099 and $8,499 for
                their intensive course.

              <h4>Private Tutoring</h4>
              <p>
                Kaplan also offers private tutoring at around $140 per hour.
                Included with their private tutoring offers is either an
                in-person or an online course, so in a way you're just adding a
                few hundred to three thousand dollars to your usual Kaplan MCAT
                prep course cost. For full details, visit
                <a href="http://bit.ly/kaplan-mcat">this page</a>.
              </p>

              <h4>Online Options</h4>

                online options available. These range from getting live
                instruction from a tutor online to purely online options. These
                range from $1899 to $2099.

                  <h3>Mike's Take/Kaplan MCAT Prep Pros and Cons</h3>
                  <p>
                    You won't get any kind of written materials with Kaplan MCAT
                    prep course, so it's probably not the best choice if you
                    learn that way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There's also some question of how well Kaplan's practice
                    questions reflect the real test. In a study done on
                    studentdoc.com, students scoring an average of a 27 on the
                    practice tests could have scored anywhere between a 9 and a
                    36 on the real test! You can see this study
                    <a href="http://www.studentdoc.com/practice-mcat.html"
                      >here</a
                    >. The AAMC's were the best.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What you should take from that is that Kaplan will
                    definitely teach you what you need to know for the test, but
                    don't use their practice tests as a gauge for how you'll
                    perform. Instead, use the AAMC tests which they give you
                    access to.
                  </p>

              <p>
                Kaplan also offers their higher score guarantee, which should
                give you comfort that even if their questions don't mimic the
                real exam, if you don't do better you can get your money back
                (or study longer with them, but not both, details on my Kaplan
                review page).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also buy prep programs for just one subject, which is a
                nice feature if you really just need help with, for example,
                physics. You can pay a few hundred to get solid preparation
                instead of several thousand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kaplan MCAT prep course also has Smart Reports, which is a cool
                system that helps you target your weak areas when you take
                practice exams and practice questions. That software will help
                you maximize your study time. For a more detailed pros and cons
                discussion, visit my Kaplan review page.
              </p>
              <p class="font-bold">
                My bottom line is that if you learn a lot from lectures and
                practice questions, Kaplan is probably your best choice. You'll
                get the most practice questions by far compared to other
                programs and you'll have access to online lecture materials that
                you can access whenever you want.

                    For the Princeton MCAT prep course as with the Kaplan MCAT
                    prep course, you will find students who have done well on
                    certain sections of the MCAT as your instructors. Princeton
                    Review MCAT is slightly more transparent about their hiring
                    policies, explaining the selection process as having a
                    "subject knowledge screening test, teaching audition and
                    vigorous training process." Overall, the teachers you get in
                    both will be pretty similar, although some say that
                    Princeton Review MCAT prep course goes into a little more
                    detail than Kaplan MCAT prep course.

                You'll start with a practice test so that you can have a
                baseline for Princeton Review MCAT's higher score guarantee.
                You'll then attend either in class or online lectures for a
                total of 105 hours over 3 months. That's a lot of MCAT! Find
                more about this on my full page about Princeton Review MCAT.

                    8 AAMC practice tests and 11 Princeton Review practice
                    tests, along with a lot of printed material (3,000+ pages of
                    basic review in textbook style), and 2700 questions with
                    Amplifire (a software that helps you move things you learn
                    from short term to long term memory). These range from $2099

                    nice option, to $8499 for their intensive option. Private
                    tutoring is also available for between about $150 and $300

                    So, which of these two might be the right course for you? I
                    gave my basic conclusion above: If you learn better studying
                    online and with practice questions, I'd go with Kaplan.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you learn better with in class and one-on-one attention
                    and/or written materials, I'd go with Princeton Review.

                    However, it's always fun to go head to head, so let's look
                    at a few categories.

              <h3>Time In Class</h3>
              <p>
                Here is a very clear distinction between The Princeton Review
                MCAT and Kaplan MCAT prep course. With the Kaplan classroom
                course, you'll get 52 hours of in-class time over 24 sessions.
                Not too bad, until you compare it to the 105 hours and 40+
                sessions with The Princeton Review, along with 20+ hours of
                one-on-one time with an instructor. There really isn't much
                comparison.

              <h3>Written Materials</h3>
              <p>
                This is another blow-away section by Princeton Review MCAT. If
                you choose to sign up with TPR, you'll get around 3,000 pages of
                written material that you can review, including basic science
                review that is basically like mini textbooks in each area tested
                on the MCAT. With Kaplan, everything is basically done online
                with no written materials.

              <h3>Online Materials</h3>
              <p>
                Spoiler alert: Kaplan MCAT definitely gets the edge here in
                Kaplan vs Princeton Review MCAT. You'll get access to 130 hours
                of online lecture by Kaplan's best instructors with any course
                you sign up with, including private tutoring. You also get
                11,000 practice questions (all online), vs 2,700 with The
                Princeton Review online with Amplifire. What about Princeton
                Review MCAT? Only if you sign up for their online course, MCAT
                Live Online. You will, however, get the lectures recorded for
                your review (the lectures you attended online) with Princeton
                Review's Live Online course. You also get some online drills
                with Princeton Review, but it's not on the same level of great
                teachers teaching you material like Kaplan.

              <h3>Kaplan vs Princeton Review MCAT Price</h3>
              <p>
                The Princeton Review MCAT prep course used to be several hundred
                dollars cheaper than Kaplan MCAT prep courses, but now they are
                almost exactly the same. It will basically come down to who has
                the better deal that particular month.

              <h3>Practice Questions</h3>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col col-12 col-md-8">
                  <p>
                    I have reviewed both MCAT prep courses' practice questions,
                    along with the AAMC questions and have taken the MCAT. In my
                    opinion, Princeton Review MCAT questions more closely mimic
                    the real MCAT. The real MCAT is more focused on
                    understanding the principles behind formulas and their
                    relationships than it is on knowing the exact formulas. For
                    more on this, click here. The Princeton MCAT questions have
                    this same flavor to them. Many of the Kaplan MCAT questions
                    also have this flavor, but many are too detailed, in my
                    opinion. They test specifics of formulas that you will not
                    likely have to know for the MCAT.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is also consistent with studies done by studentdoc.com
                    and by reviews by other people who took the review courses
                    and the MCAT. According to data collected by studentdoc.com,
                    scores on Kaplan practice tests were poor predictors of
                    actual test performance. For example, a student might have
                    scored a 9 on a Kaplan section could score between a 3 and a
                    12 on the real MCAT!
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col col-12 col-md-4">

              </div>
              <p>
                Princeton Review was also a poor predictor, but generally if
                someone scored, for example, an 8 on a Princeton test, they
                would usually score 8 or better on the real test. AAMC was the
                best predictor, which makes sense since they wrote the test. For
                this study, click here.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, either way, use the AAMC tests to judge your actual score.
                But, as for me, I'd rather score lower on a practice test and
                higher on the real deal. So, I give the edge to:

              <h3>Higher Score Guarantee</h3>
              <p>
                Both MCAT prep course companies come to the table with a similar
                guarantee.
              </p>
              <p>Kaplan's is essentially that:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If you're not ready, you can keep studying with them for 3
                  months
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you're not satisfied with your score (even if it's higher),
                  you can keep studying with them for 3 months.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you don't raise your overall score, you can retake a course
                  or get your money back.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                You do have to do all of your homework and practice tests to
                qualify for the higher score guarantee or do makeup sessions if
                you miss a class. To claim any of these, you need to claim a
                refund within 90 days of finishing your course.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, the refund guarantee applies in a strange way to the
                summer intensive program. If you go to that and don't score
                higher, you can choose a different Kaplan course to repeat for
                free or get a discount on next year's summer intensive. You can
                also keep studying with them if you don't feel ready. You might
                be eligible for money back. According to my call with Kaplan,
                "if you ask for money back, the directors of the summer
                intensive program will review your case and determine how much
                money you are eligible for." A little scary considering how much
                that program costs!
              </p>
              <p>
                The money back guarantee also does not apply to tutoring. If you
                want to repeat tutoring, you'll get it at a discounted rate, but
                still will have to pay it. Remember with Kaplan you get a course
                with your tutoring.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, keep in mind that you can only choose one of these offers.
                So, don't think you can say you're not ready, study for 3 more
                months, then if you don't get a higher score you get your money
                back. You can only choose one.
              </p>
              <p>The Princeton Review's guarantee has 3 similar offers:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If you're not ready at the end of your course, you can repeat
                  the course or take a refresher course. You have a year from
                  the start of your program to take advantage of this. However,
                  it will cost you $300 to use this and you won't get
                  replacement materials. Those cost $200 if you want a new set
                  of written materials. This does not apply to private tutoring.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you're not satisfied with your MCAT score (even if it's
                  higher), you can keep working with Princeton Review for up to
                  a year. Just take the MCAT within 45 days of finishing your
                  course. If you take it after 45 days, you'll pay the $300 fee
                  and maybe $200 to buy new supplies. You can't repeat private
                  tutoring. If you chose that initially, you can take a
                  classroom or online class.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If your score doesn't improve, you can get your money back.
                  You need to take your test within 45 days of finishing and
                  need to show your score to Princeton Review within 90 days of
                  finishing your course. This one does apply to Ultimate MCAT,
                  but you'll have to take a repeat course of in class or online,
                  then take the MCAT again and still get a lower score. Then you
                  can get your money back.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Again, you can only choose one of these. Once you use one, the
                others are gone.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd have to say that I give the edge to Princeton Review on
                this. I like that you can study with them for up to a year if
                you're not satisfied and that their money back guarantee applies
                to their intensive summer course. However, you do have to pay
                that administrative fee that you don't with Kaplan, so a slim
                win but still a win to Princeton Review.

              <h3>Teachers and Private Tutors</h3>
              <p>
                For in class teachers, this one is a draw. Both are going to be
                students who did well on the MCAT and were screened to make sure
                they can teach.
              </p>
              <p>
                You do have different things when it comes to private tutoring,
                though. With Kaplan, you'll be paying around $140 per hour for a
                private tutor. It's not totally clear on Kaplan's site, though,
                what kind of experience this tutor has. Likely it's someone who
                has been a solid teacher who Kaplan trusts to privately tutor.
                You'll also get a full prep course included in the cost, so you
                could say you're paying about $70 an hour for a private tutor if
                you take out the cost of the course.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Princeton Review MCAT prep course, you can choose from
                three different tiers of tutor. Private tutors are classroom
                teachers with great reviews, but no proven track record. You'll
                pay $150 an hour for 48 hours. Master tutors have 500+ hours of
                instructing time and have proven great results with previous
                clients. These will cost you around $200 an hour. Finally, there
                are Premier tutors who have 1000+ hours of instruction and great
                track records of success. You'll pay around $300 an hour for 48
                hours with these guys.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, I'd give private tutoring a slight edge to Princeton Review,
                just because if you pay for it, you'll get someone who has shown
                they can help people get a better score.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, with Princeton Review you'll also get 20 one-on-one
                hours built into the price you already pay for their course,
                while you'll pay several hundred to thousands of dollars more
                with Kaplan for any private tutoring to add on to their course.

                I wouldn't have noticed this before building my own website, but
                Kaplan's site is a lot prettier and a lot easier to navigate
                than Princeton Review's. So, a clear winner here.

                Ok, so we spent a long time talking about the Goliaths in MCAT
                prep courses, but what about the Davids? Here you'll find my
                review of a few of the up and coming MCAT prep courses.

              <p>
                If you do choose some of these options, you can save a
                significant amount of money compared to our friends Kaplan and
                Princeton Review.

                This is an up and coming company that has had overall good
                reviews by students. Probably the biggest benefit of this
                program is the price. You'll be looking at something similar to
                the online lectures that are provided by Kaplan with the written
                materials that are provided by Princeton Review.
              </p>
              <p>
                The overall cost of a complete package is $1200, which is
                significantly less than the options described above. You'll get
                16 DVDs of lecture material, along with several books.

                Dr. Ferdinand is the teacher of all the material in this MCAT
                prep course, and you can see his teaching style
                <a
                  href="http://affiliates.gold-standard.com/t/url.php/cid/48/sid/29/affid/149"
                  >here</a
                >. I'd rank him as an average teacher.
              </p>
              <p>
                He's also opened up a similar intensive course in Las Vegas, NV
                and Montreal, Quebec, Canada where you can live the MCAT for a
                week.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another nice option with this company is to get online access to
                lectures, practice tests and materials for a monthly fee. This
                could really cut down on the amount you spend preparing for the
                MCAT, since it ranges between $49.95 and $79.95 per month
                depending on the package you sign up for. Since you'll probably
                be studying somewhere between 4 and 6 months, if you like to
                study online, this is probably your most affordable option by a
                long shot.
              </p>
              <p>
                As far as how well their practice tests mimic the real deal,
                from student reports it's pretty well in line with the real
                MCAT.
